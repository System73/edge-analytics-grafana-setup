## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute as long as you follow some rules to ensure consistency, sustainability
and efficiency:

* [x] Create a branch with a meaningful name.
* [x] Make *commits* following the [Conventional Commits][conv-commits] style.
* [x] Core contributors have decided to **follow a rebase strategy** to keep branches up-to-date
  with the latest changes on *main* so please **do not introduce *merge commits*** unless absolutely
  justified. If you are not familiar with the rebase approach you can find quick intro
  [here][how-to-rebase] or you can always ask for help.
* [x] Open a *Merge Requests*.
