# Self-hosted Grafana integration with Edge Analytics

## Requirements

* Grafana OSS 9.x.x
* Docker 20.10+ (linux)
* docker-compose 1.29+ (linux)

## Instructions

**Note:** This guide assumes that you have a Grafana already [installed][grafana-install-docs]
and running in a supported environment but for demonstration purposes the guide will provide
instructions for the Docker-based deployment as it is more portable and cross-platform.

### Getting Grafana up and running (Linux only)

1. First download the docker-compose file from [here](./files/docker-compose.yaml).

2. On a terminal opened in the same directory where you download the docker-compose.yaml file you
can simply type: `docker compose up -d grafana`
3. Go to the browser and open the page [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
On the login page enter the default admin credentials
User: admin, Password: admin
4. For increased security Grafana prompts for setting a new admin password, please do so or skip it.

### Installing the required plugins/datasources

To integrate with the Edge Analytics API Grafana needs a plugin that is able to consume JSON APIs.
There are many plugins available to do so but the plugin
[JSON API Data Source for Grafana][grafana-json-datasource] is officially maintained by Grafana Labs
and it perfectly covers our needs.

To install the plugin from the UI you just have to (other installation methods described
[here][grafana-json-datasource-install]):

1. Navigate to the *Configuration > Plugins* section.
![Configuration > Plugins](./images/plugins.png)
2. Search for the term “JSON API” so you should get the plugin developed by Marcus Olsson.

3. Click on the *Install* button.

4. Click on the *Create a JSON API* data source button.

5. Configure the data source with the following values:
   1. Name: Dremel API
   2. URL: [https://api.system73.com/analytics](https://api.system73.com/analytics)
   3. Add a header on *Custom HTTP Headers* with the following:
      1. Header: `Authorization`
      2. Value: `Bearer <edge_analytics_api_key>` (Available on [System73 Portal][s73-portal])

6. Click on the *Save & test* button (ignore the warning message) and click on the Back button.

### Importing Edge Analytics dashboards

You can import the Edge Analytics dashboards that we have made available:

* [Basic dashboard](./files/ea-basic-dashboard.json)
* [Advanced dashboard](./files/ea-advanced-dashboard.json)

To import a dashboard:

1. Click on the sidebar’s *Dashboards > Import*
![Dashboards > Import](./images/dashboard-import.png)
2. You can either upload the dashboard file or simply copy & paste the file context. Since we are
using a container without specific host-mounted volumes it is better to simply copy its content.
![Import via JSON](./images/dashboard-load.png)
3. Click on the *Load button*
4. You can choose the dashboard uid, tittle, folder as you want but make sure to select the
*Dremel API* as the dashboard datasource in the drop-down menu.

5. Click on the *Import* button
6. After that you just need to select the correct region and the Edge Intelligence Id that you have
been assigned.
